# Amazon project website

[Live Web Page](https://mkamilamin.github.io/Amazon-website/)

The Amazon project website is an example website made with pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The motivation behind this project was to gain experience working on a website that's more advanced than the projects I did till now.

## I use the following types of commits:

-   `📦 NEW:` Added new functionality

-   `🐛 FIX:` Bug fixes

-   `👌 IMPROVE:` Code edits without fixing bugs or adding new features

-   `📖 DOC:` Documentation update
